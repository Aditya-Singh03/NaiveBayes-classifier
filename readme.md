## How to run this program (its very simple and concise)<br>
**Just type**
>`python run.py`

in the terminal and you will be able to run the model and create the its plots in one go. All the plots will also get saved in this very same folder. (Just make sure that when you try to run this file, you are in the same folder as the file's parent folder) Also, above every question, there exists a heading speciying the question number. 

**Make sure that you run the code with all the train/test data, because I had to delete the train/test data folders as they were too big to upload on gradescope**

**Make sure to uncomment the `plt.savefig('Q1-1.png')` (such lines) to also save the figure**

(If `python run.py` does not work, then try `python3 run.py`)
